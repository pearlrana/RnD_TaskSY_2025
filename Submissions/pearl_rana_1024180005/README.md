# 🌟 Personal Portfolio – R&D Task Submission by Pearl Rana

## 🎨 Inspiration Behind the Design

This one-page personal portfolio website is a digital reflection of who I am a blend of creativity, emotion, and minimal tech flair. I aimed to design a soft yet expressive interface using a muted pastel color palette, rounded corners, and smooth content transitions. I took inspiration from the elegance and layout style of **ECHOES TIET Magazine**, while adding my own aesthetic flair.

## 🧠 Highlights & Features

- **Fully responsive layout** – Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Minimalist, clean aesthetic** – Pastel tones, soft shadows, and simple layouts.
- **Custom contact form** – Connected via **EmailJS** to send messages directly to my inbox.
- **Social links integration** – Includes GitHub  and LinkedIn.
- **Smooth animations** – Hover effects, transitions, and scroll reveals using CSS.
- **No external frameworks** – Entirely coded using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for contact form functionality

## 📸 Creative Touches

## 📝 Final Thoughts

This portfolio was a fun yet challenging way for me to blend creativity with code. I kept the website light and aesthetically soft something that speaks for my design taste. While I'm still growing as a developer, this task gave me the confidence to create and host a complete website on my own.

Thank you for this opportunity to express myself through design and development!
